//Instruction:
//Write a simple for loop that iterates from 1 to 5 and prints the value of the loop variable i on each iteration.

 public class LoopTest {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
  
    for(int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
      System.out.println(i);
    }
  }
}
// My Explanation
//We initiate the for loop with int i = 1, and the loop will continue while i <= 5. The loop prints the value of i each time it runs. Once i exceeds 5, the loop will stop. 
//The output will print the numbers 1 through 5.
